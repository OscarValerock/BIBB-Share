## Content Guidelines

- **Relevance**: Your content must be related to the domains of Business Intelligence, User Experience, or the synergy between the two. It should offer practical insights, detailed analysis, or inspiring stories that resonate with our audience.
- **Originality**: The articles should not have been published elsewhere, or the canonical link should point to BIBB.
- **Quality**: Your post should be well-written, clear, and concise. To improve readability, use subheadings, bullet points, and short paragraphs. Ensure that your content is free of grammatical errors and typos.
- **Evidence-Based**: Support your claims with data, examples, or case studies. We value informative and research-backed content.
- **Non-Promotional**: We aim to provide our readers with unbiased, informative content. The post's header can include a relevant link to your website or social media, but the article's body should be free from sales pitches.
- **Use AI thoughtfully and sparingly**: We support using AI in our activities, but we expect real people to write most of the content.
- **Length**: Aim for a post length between 1,500 and 2,500 words.

## Submission Process

1. **Confirmation of interest**: Great! If you are reading this, it means your are interested in writing in our Blog.
2. **Agree on the topic**: Tell us what you plan to write about to confirm it aligns with our blog. Drop us a quick mail with your blog post idea to [contact_bibb@bibb.pro](mailto:contact_bibb@bibb.pro), and we will get in touch with you.
3. **Start writing**: We love MD, but you are welcome to share the post in the format that you like the most.
4. **Review Process**:
    - We will review your submission and suggest revisions. We reserve the right to edit the content for clarity, style, and alignment with our guidelines.
    - Grammar and spelling: We check with Grammarly and use British English.
    - AI Checker: We ensure the blog posts do not contain text mostly written by AI.
    - Style: We may change the text to match the style of BIBB; these edits will not change the nature of the original writing.
    - Plagiarism checker: A plagiarism check helps to avoid plagiarism and find overly generic (and, therefore, possibly boring) sentences.
    - SEO: Most of our suggestions and/or edits will ensure the text covers the basics: Keywords, Titles, keyword density, and URL Slug. No worries if you know nothing about SEO; we've got you covered and can take care of this ðŸ˜‰.
5. **Publication**: Once we agree on the final version, we will schedule it for publication. We will inform you of the publication date and share the live link once it's posted.
