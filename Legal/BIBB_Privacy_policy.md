2. Processing is unlawful and you oppose deletion;
3. We no longer need the data for processing purposes, but you need it for legal claims; or
4. You objected under Art. 21 (1) GDPR and verification is pending.

### 4. Right to Deletion ("Right to be Forgotten")

#### a) Obligation to Delete

We must delete your personal data **without undue delay** if:

- It is no longer necessary for the purposes collected.
- You withdraw consent (Art. 6 (1) a or Art. 9 (2) a GDPR) and no other legal basis exists.

- The data was processed unlawfully.
- Deletion is required by legal obligation.

If we have made the data public, we will take reasonable steps (including technical measures) to inform other controllers processing the data that you requested deletion of links, copies or replications.

#### b) Exceptions

The right to deletion does **not** apply where processing is necessary:

- To exercise freedom of expression and information;
- To comply with a legal obligation or perform a task in the public interest/exercise of official authority;
- For public‑interest reasons in public health (Art. 9 (2) h, i and 9 (3) GDPR);

### 5. Right to Notification

If you exercise rights to rectification, deletion or restriction, we will notify each recipient of your personal data unless impossible or involving disproportionate effort.

### 6. Data Portability

You have the right to receive personal data you provided to us *in a structured, commonly used and machine‑readable format* and to transmit it to another controller where processing is based on consent (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR / Art. 9 (2) a GDPR) or contract (Art. 6 (1) b GDPR) and carried out by automated means. Where technically feasible, you may request direct transmission.

### 7. Right to Objection

You may object **at any time**, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to processing based on Art. 6 (1) e or f GDPR (including profiling). We shall cease processing unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds overriding your interests or for legal claims.

Where personal data is processed for **direct marketing**, you may object at any time, including to profiling related to such marketing; we will then no longer process data for that purpose.

### 8. Right to Withdraw Consent

You may withdraw your consent **at any time**. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before withdrawal.

### 9. Right of Appeal to a Supervisory Authority

Without prejudice to other remedies, you may lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe processing of your personal data contravenes applicable law.
